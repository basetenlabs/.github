# Welcome to Baseten

Baseten is the machine learning infrastructure platform to serve models of any size and modality and do so performantly, scalably, and affordably for production use cases.

Get started:

* Deploy a foundation model like [Mistral 7B](https://www.baseten.co/library/mistral-7b-instruct/) or [Stable Diffusion XL](https://www.baseten.co/library/stable-diffusion-xl/) in two clicks from the [model library](https://www.baseten.co/library/)
* Read our [quickstart guide](https://truss.baseten.co/quickstart) to package and serve a model in under five minutes.

## Truss

Truss, an open-source project by Baseten, is the simplest way to serve AI/ML models in production.

Why Truss?

* **Write once, run anywhere:** Package and test model code, weights, and dependencies with a model server that behaves the same in development and production.
* **Fast developer loop:** Implement your model with fast feedback from a live reload server, and skip Docker and Kubernetes configuration with Truss' done-for-you model serving environment.
* **Support for all Python frameworks**: From `transformers` and `diffusors` to `PyTorch` and `Tensorflow` to `XGBoost` and `sklearn`, Truss supports models created with any framework, even entirely custom models.
